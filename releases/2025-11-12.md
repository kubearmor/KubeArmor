# Release notes - 2025-11-12

## Improvements
- Removed publishing of cosign certificate artifact (.cert) from the release signing configuration; signatures are now provided as ${artifact}.sigstore.json only. If you automated verification using the .cert file, switch to `cosign verify` or Rekor-based verification.
