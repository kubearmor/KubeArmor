# RHEL kernel compilation fix for system monitor
Date: 2025-11-11
Version: Unreleased

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed system monitor compilation on RHEL-based kernels (5.14.0-400+ builds) by detecting backported struct changes and compiling the appropriate code path. Added the **RHEL_BUILD_GTE_400** build flag to ensure compatibility. Commit: [38125ff](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/commit/38125ff38b0983af8c31b45ca1b4b198a66a1814).
