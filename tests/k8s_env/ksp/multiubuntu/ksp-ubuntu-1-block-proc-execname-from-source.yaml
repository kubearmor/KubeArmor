# Test for issue #1899 fix: execname + fromSource support in BPF-LSM
# This policy blocks curl execution when called from /bin/dash
# Before the fix, this would fail - the fromSource check was not implemented for execname
# After the fix, this should properly block: Dash -c "curl http://example.com"
