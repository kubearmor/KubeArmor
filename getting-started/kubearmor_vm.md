# KubeArmor on VM/Bare-Metal

This recipe explains how to use KubeArmor directly on VM/Bare-Metal host and was tested on Ubuntu hosts. The recipe installs `kubearmor` as systemd process and `karmor` cli tool to manage policies and show alerts/telemetry.

## Download and Install KubeArmor

1. Install pre-requisites `sudo apt install bpfcc-tools linux-headers-$(uname -r)`
2. Download the [latest release of KubeArmor](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/releases)
2. Install KubeArmor `sudo dpkg -i kubearmor_VER_linux-amd64.deb` ... where VER is the kubearmor release version

## Start KubeArmor

```
sudo systemctl start kubearmor
```

Check kubearmor status using `sudo systemctl status kubearmor` or use `sudo journalctl -u kubearmor -f` to continuously monitor kubearmor logs.

## Apply sample policy

Following policy is to deny execution of `sleep` binary on the host:

```yaml=
apiVersion: security.kubearmor.com/v1
kind: KubeArmorHostPolicy
metadata:
  name: hsp-kubearmor-dev-proc-path-block
spec:
  process:
    matchPaths:
    - path: /usr/bin/sleep # try sleep 1
  action:
    Block
```

Save the above policy to _`hostpolicy.yaml`_ and apply:
```
karmor vm policy add hostpolicy.yaml
```

**Now if you run `sleep` command, the process would be denied execution.**

## Get Alerts for policies and telemetry

```
karmor log --json
```

```json=
