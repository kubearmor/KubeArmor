# KubeArmor v1.7 Release Notes

**Date:** 2025-11-28
**Version:** v1.7.0

## Improvements

- Improved KubeArmor operator handling of image configuration, centralizing image, pull secret, toleration, node selector, and environment updates for the agent, init, relay, and controller components. The operator now respects both global defaults and per-component overrides from the KubeArmorConfig resource while reusing image pull secrets from the operator deployment across all managed images.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed resource and map handling issues in the system monitor and IMA hash integration to improve compatibility and stability on kernels such as RHEL and other 5.4-based kernels, including safer buffer bounds checks, more robust PID namespace tracking, and graceful fallback when IMA BPF programs or rlimit adjustments fail.
