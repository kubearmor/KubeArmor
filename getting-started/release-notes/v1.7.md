# KubeArmor v1.7 Release Notes

**Date:** 2026-01-05  
**Version:** v1.7.0

## 🎁 Misc

- Improved our internal automated tests for Kubernetes policies so they wait more patiently for system changes, making test results more reliable without changing any behavior that users see. These changes fine-tune CI test timing by extending sleep intervals, increasing timeouts for collecting logs and alerts, and adding dedicated nginx posture test resources across block posture, Kubernetes Security Posture (KSP), throttling, and visibility test suites.
