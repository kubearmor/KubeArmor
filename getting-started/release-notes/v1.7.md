# KubeArmor v1.7 Release Notes

## 🎁 Misc

- Updated the configuration of the KubeArmor Helm chart so that it more reliably uses pinned container images and registry secrets when deployed from marketplace automation. This update adjusts the GitHub-based marketplace packaging workflow to rewrite global.kubearmor image tags, repositories, and operator-related fields in values.yaml and Chart.yaml using yq so that generated charts ship with autoDeploy and imagePinning enabled for the intended release versions.
