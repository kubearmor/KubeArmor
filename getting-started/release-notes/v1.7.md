# KubeArmor v1.7 Release Notes

## 🎁 Misc

- Clarified the wording of a startup warning message so that it is easier to understand when a previous cleanup did not complete correctly. The log line in KubeArmor/main.go was updated to say "Deleting existing map %s. This means previous cleanup failed" while leaving all underlying behavior and conditions exactly the same.
