# KubeArmor v1.7 Release Notes

Release date: 2025-11-28

## New Features

- Added support for consuming imagePullSecrets defined for the kubearmor-operator and propagating them to all managed KubeArmor components (daemonsets, relay, controller, snitch jobs), enabling deployments to pull images from private registries without additional manual configuration while still honoring any imagePullSecrets and global image pull secret settings already configured in KubeArmorConfig.
