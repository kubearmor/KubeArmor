# KubeArmor v1.7 Release Notes

## 🆕 New Features

- Added support for IPv6 host addresses so KubeArmor can run reliably in dual-stack and IPv6-only Kubernetes environments without losing visibility into node network activity. This change extended host networking and monitoring logic to correctly handle IPv6 address formats in the relevant components and ensured policies and observability features work when nodes expose IPv6 addresses.
- Enabled configuration of CPU and memory requests and limits for KubeArmor components when installing via the Helm chart so operators can better control cluster resource usage. The Helm values and templates now honor configurable `resources` fields (including `kubearmor.resources` and `kubearmorController.resources`) for the DaemonSet and controller containers, aligning the chart with Kubernetes resource management best practices.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Improved the completeness and accuracy of runtime logs so that alerts and process activity are easier to interpret. The monitor and logging paths were updated to fill in previously missing PRESET log fields, correct grammar in a user-facing main.go log line, and repair cases where the `parentProcessName` field in process logs could be empty by consulting the host PID map, along with fixing Helm imagePullSecret handling that could cause configuration issues.

## 🎁 Misc

- Improved Helm-based deployments and release packaging so that installing and upgrading KubeArmor is more predictable. The Helm charts and values were updated to mark v1.6.5 as the stable chart version, bump app and chart versions appropriately, expose resource configuration fields in values files, and align marketplace and CI workflows with the v1.6.6 release configuration.
- Enhanced DNS visibility documentation and data formatting so users can better understand and analyze DNS-related activity. New and updated DNS visibility docs explain how to enable and interpret DNS data, while structured DNS log outputs now use clearer space-separated formatting to make downstream processing and observability tooling integration easier.
- Updated project documentation and contribution guidance so it is easier for users and contributors to work with the project. The changes fixed a broken link in the contributing guide, adjusted various documentation pages to reflect v1.6.6 behavior, and summarized the main Helm, logging, IPv6, DNS, and testing improvements introduced in this release.
- Stabilized tests and dependencies so that the v1.6.6 release pipeline and ongoing CI runs are more reliable. Test manifests and Ginkgo definitions for Kubernetes block posture scenarios were updated, Go module dependencies were refreshed to address known Go vulnerabilities, and controller testing guides and workflows were adjusted to keep automated verification in sync with the latest code.
