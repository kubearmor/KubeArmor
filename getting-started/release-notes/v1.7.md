# KubeArmor v1.7 Release Notes

## 🎁 Misc

- Updated our automated security checks so they now use the newest available version of the code scanning tool, without changing how developers run or configure these checks. This change bumps all CodeQL workflow steps for the Go analysis job from `github/codeql-action@v3` to `github/codeql-action@v4` while leaving the rest of the workflow configuration untouched.
