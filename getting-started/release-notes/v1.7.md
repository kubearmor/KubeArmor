# KubeArmor v1.7 Release Notes

Date: 2025-11-28  
Version: v1.7

## Improvements

- Improved KubeArmor Operator handling of image pull secrets and tolerations when updating KubeArmor, relay, and controller DaemonSets/Deployments so that secrets explicitly passed to the operator are used when global or CRD-specific settings are not set, simplifying image credential management for operator-managed components.
