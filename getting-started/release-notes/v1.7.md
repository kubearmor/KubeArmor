# KubeArmor v1.7 Release Notes

**Date:** 2026-01-07  
**Version:** v1.7.0

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed system monitor builds so they no longer fail on Red Hat-compatible systems that are not based on RHEL9 by limiting the special handling of certain kernel structures to RHEL9-only environments. The compilation logic now gates the RHEL-specific `msg_iter.__iov` access pattern behind an updated RHEL9-only detection regular expression, preventing eBPF object build errors related to `struct iov_iter` field layout on RHEL8- and RHEL10-based kernels.
