# KubeArmor v1.7 Release Notes

## 🐜 Bug Fixes

- Allowed Helm-based KubeArmor installations to let operators configure CPU and memory requests for the DaemonSet, controller, and relay components so they can better control cluster resource usage over time.
- Enabled Helm chart users to manage resource usage across all primary KubeArmor components by configuring resource requests directly in chart values instead of being forced to accept hard-coded defaults.
