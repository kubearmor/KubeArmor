# KubeArmor v1.7 Release Notes

## 🐜 Bug Fixes

- Allowed Helm-based KubeArmor installations to let operators configure CPU and memory requests for the DaemonSet, controller, and relay components so they can better control cluster resource usage over time. This change added configurable `resources` keys with default CPU and memory requests to `values.yaml` and wired them into the main DaemonSet and deployment templates so Helm values consistently drive container resource requests and limits.
- Enabled Helm chart users to manage resource usage across all primary KubeArmor components by configuring resource requests directly in chart values instead of being forced to accept hard-coded defaults. This update unified and extended the earlier controller- and relay-only configuration to also cover the main DaemonSet while keeping the same `resources` pattern and documentation in the chart README values table.
