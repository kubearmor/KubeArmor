# KubeArmor v1.7 Release Notes

## 🎁 Misc

- Updated the contributor documentation so that new contributors are directed to the correct Kubernetes helper page when getting started. This change fixes the outdated Contributor Cheat Sheet hyperlink in CONTRIBUTING.md, ensuring it now points to the current contributor-cheatsheet README in the Kubernetes community repository.
