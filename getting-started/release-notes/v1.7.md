# KubeArmor v1.7 Release Notes

## 🆕 New Features

- Added support for IPv6 host addresses so that environments using IPv6 or dual‑stack networking can be monitored and protected alongside IPv4 setups. This enhancement extended KubeArmor’s host networking, address normalization, and policy enforcement logic to correctly recognize, parse, and operate with IPv6-formatted host and service addresses across relevant components.
- Introduced configurable resource settings in the KubeArmor Helm charts so operators can tune CPU and memory usage for core components during deployment. This change added `resources` blocks to the Helm values and wired them into the Deployment and DaemonSet templates for the controller and daemon, exposing standard Kubernetes resource request and limit configuration through Helm values.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Improved process monitoring so that missing parent process names on the host are correctly resolved and reported in visibility data. This fix updated the monitor component to consult the host PID map when building the process tree, ensuring parent process metadata is reliably populated in security events and alerts.
- Corrected several small issues in project configuration, documentation, and tests so that the overall experience is more reliable and polished for users and contributors. These fixes included stabilizing a flaky Ginkgo test, repairing a broken CONTRIBUTING.md link, and aligning Helm chart defaults and values with the intended v1.6.5-based configuration for v1.6.6 deployments.

## 🎁 Misc

- Marked version v1.6.5 as the stable release and updated release metadata so users could clearly see which version was recommended for production use. This change promoted v1.6.5 in the release channels and synchronized associated packaging information to treat it as the primary stable baseline prior to and during the v1.6.6 rollout.
- Updated the KubeArmor Helm charts and default values so that installations use version-aligned images and more complete configuration out of the box. These packaging improvements bumped chart references to v1.6.5, refreshed default values, added a configurable `resources` section, and refined image pull secret handling to better support production deployments and CI workflows.
- Enhanced preset security alerts so that built-in alerts include all expected informational fields and provide clearer context. This update filled in previously missing metadata in PRESET alert definitions and refactored shared alert logic so default alert payloads are more complete and consistent for downstream tools.
- Documented DNS visibility capabilities so users can learn how to enable and interpret DNS-level observability in their clusters. This documentation addition introduced a dedicated DNS visibility guide that explains required configuration, usage patterns, and the shape of DNS-related telemetry produced by KubeArmor.
- Polished user-facing log messages and release documentation so operational information is clearer and more professional. These refinements corrected spelling and grammar in a startup log line, updated the v1.6.6 release summary with the list of merged changes and contributors, and performed minor textual and link cleanups across the project.
