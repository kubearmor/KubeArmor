# KubeArmor v1.6.5 Release Notes

_Date: 2025-12-11_

_Version: v1.6.5_

## 🐜 Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where process observability logs for container workloads could miss the parent process name and source when the host parent process was very short-lived, by reusing cached host PID map data instead of relying on short-lived procfs entries. (Fixes #2299)
