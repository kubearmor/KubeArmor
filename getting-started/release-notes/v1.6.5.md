# KubeArmor v1.6.5 Release Notes

- **Date:** 2025-12-23
- **Version:** v1.6.5

## 🔕 New Features

- Allowed configuring CPU and memory resources for both the KubeArmor DaemonSet and controller pods through Helm values so operators can fine‑tune how KubeArmor workloads use cluster resources. The KubeArmor Helm chart now exposes configurable resources blocks for the DaemonSet and controller deployments, with documented kubearmor.resources and kubearmorController.resources values in the chart README and values.yaml.

## 🐜 Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where some process logs could show an empty parent process name so that process lineage information is clearer and more reliable for operators. The monitoring logic for processTree handling was updated to also consult the host pidMap when resolving parent process names, ensuring process ancestry fields in logs are populated more consistently.

## 🎁 Misc

- Marked v1.6.5 as the stable release and aligned Helm chart and project metadata so packaging tools and users consistently recognize v1.6.5 as the recommended stable version. The release channel designation, Helm Chart.yaml versions, and the STABLE-RELEASE indicator were updated to reference v1.6.5 as the stable track for chart and binary distribution.
- Improved Helm chart configuration and operator manifests so that image pull secrets and resource settings can be managed more flexibly during installation. The KubeArmor and KubeArmorOperator Helm charts were updated to support imagePullSecrets configuration and to expose resource configuration fields for their pods, improving compatibility with private registries and enabling more precise resource tuning.
- Improved installation configuration and runtime visibility options across the Helm charts and monitoring components in the v1.6 line to make the system easier to deploy and observe. The changes added configurability for image pull secrets and container resource limits, updated DNS visibility documentation, enriched preset logs with additional fields, and refreshed various log messages, tests, and links to enhance reliability and clarity.
- Updated internal log output text so that a startup message reads correctly and is easier to understand. A typo and minor spelling and grammar issues in the KubeArmor main.go log string were corrected without changing any runtime behavior or configuration semantics.
- Improved Helm chart configuration by adding resource settings for the KubeArmor DaemonSet and controller containers so operators can better manage cluster resource usage. The KubeArmor Helm chart templates and default values were extended with configurable resources fields for DaemonSet pods and the kubearmorController, and the chart README and values were refreshed to document these options.
- Formatted DNS structured log data in a clearer, space‑separated style so that DNS information is easier to read and process with external tools. The DNS log formatter in the monitoring component was updated so that structured DNS fields are emitted as space‑separated values instead of the previous format, simplifying downstream parsing and analysis.
- Enhanced preset‑generated security alerts so they carry more consistent and descriptive policy information for people consuming logs. Shared helpers now populate preset logs with policy metadata such as policy name, severity, message, and tags, mark them as MatchedPolicy events, and stamp the current KubeArmor version when updating logs from SecurityPolicy objects.
- Updated project documentation links so contributors are directed to the correct contributing guide when learning how to participate in the project. A broken hyperlink in CONTRIBUTING.md was fixed so that it points to the valid contributing guidelines page instead of the previous invalid target.
- Documented the scope of the v1.6.6 patch release so users understand the main areas of change in this version. The release notes summarize improvements to Helm configuration (including configurable resources and image pull secrets), DNS visibility documentation and log formatting, preset log enrichment, process‑log parent resolution, IPv6 host support, Go module vulnerability updates, test stabilizations, and minor documentation and logging text corrections.
