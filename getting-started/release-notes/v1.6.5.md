# KubeArmor v1.6.5 Release Notes

- **Date:** 2025-12-05
- **Version:** v1.6.5

## Improvements

- Updated dependencies across multiple Go modules to address known Go vulnerabilities, hardening the core, controller, operator, deployments, protobuf definitions, and tests against security issues.
- Improved in-cluster Kubernetes API connectivity by normalizing IPv4 and IPv6 values from `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST`, ensuring reliable HTTPS requests and policy watch endpoints when the API server is exposed via an IPv6 address.
