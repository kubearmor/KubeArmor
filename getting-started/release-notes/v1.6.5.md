# KubeArmor v1.6.5 Release Notes

**Release date:** 2025-12-11  
**Version:** v1.6.5

- Filled in missing metadata fields (policy name, tags, severity, message, type, KubeArmor version) in PRESET-generated alerts/logs so they now include the same contextual information as regular KubeArmor policy alerts. (Fixes #2302)
