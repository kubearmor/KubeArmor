# KubeArmor v1.6.5 Release Notes

- **Date:** 2025-12-23
- **Version:** v1.6.5

## 🔕 New Features

- Allowed configuring CPU and memory resources for both the KubeArmor DaemonSet and controller pods through Helm values so operators can fine‑tune how KubeArmor workloads use cluster resources.

## 🐜 Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where some process logs could show an empty parent process name so that process lineage information is clearer and more reliable for operators.

## 🎁 Misc

- Marked v1.6.5 as the stable release and aligned Helm chart and project metadata so packaging tools and users consistently recognize v1.6.5 as the recommended stable version.
- Improved Helm chart configuration and operator manifests so that image pull secrets and resource settings can be managed more flexibly during installation.
- Improved installation configuration and runtime visibility options across the Helm charts and monitoring components in the v1.6 line to make the system easier to deploy and observe.

- Improved Helm chart configuration by adding resource settings for the KubeArmor DaemonSet and controller containers so operators can better manage cluster resource usage.
- Formatted DNS structured log data in a clearer, space‑separated style so that DNS information is easier to read and process with external tools.

- Updated project documentation links so contributors are directed to the correct contributing guide when learning how to participate in the project.
