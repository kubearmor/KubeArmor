## üîë Key Highlights

- **Runtime Protection for Kubernetes Clusters**
  Secure clusters at runtime with **fine-grained policies** to prevent unauthorized access and block malicious activity.

- **Cluster-wide Security Policies**
  Support for **cluster-level policies** enables security enforcement beyond namespaces for organization-wide protection. KubeArmor enforces **Cluster Security Policies (CSPs)** that allow you to define security controls across the entire cluster. CSPs provide a unified way to manage container workloads at scale, enabling global policy enforcement across namespaces.

- **KubeArmor Presets**
  Simplify security policy deployment with **predefined policy templates** for common use cases like:
  - Blocking fileless execution
  - Protecting environment variables
  - Auditing and *blocking* `kubectl exec` commands
  To use presets, specify the `preset-rule` field in your `KubeArmorPolicy`. [Learn more here.](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/issues/1295)

- **Minikube and Killercoda Playground Support**
  Set up quick test environments for demos and PoCs effortlessly.

- **Support for SCTP and All Protocols**
  Added the ability to handle SCTP protocol and all protocols with raw socket, including `protocol: all` network rule.

- **OpenSSF Scorecard Improvements**
  Reduced attack surfaces and enhanced compliance by optimizing **SecComp profiles** and minimizing host exposure.

- **NRI Handler Support**
  Implemented NRI (Network Resource Interface) handler to extend runtime integrations.
