{
  "🆕 New Features": [
    "You can now control the order in which Linux security modules are used during test runs. This adds an `lsm` order flag to the test setup and passes it through to the KubeArmor execution so the runtime uses the requested LSM ordering."
  ],
  "🎁 Misc": [
    "Continuous integration now uses the correct Helm value key when setting the KubeArmor operator image tag. This updates CI workflows to write the `kubearmor-operator` image tag to the updated Helm values path so deployments pick up the intended operator version."
  ]
}
