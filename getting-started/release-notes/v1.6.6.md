# KubeArmor v1.6.6 Release Notes

**Date:** 2026-02-04  
**Version:** v1.6.6

<!--
NOTE: The section below is an auto-injected JSON payload ({
  "🆕 New Features": [
    "Improved how the system records process execution events so entries with incomplete process details are skipped instead of producing confusing logs. Specifically, process-name/process-info validation is now centralized and applied to syscall exec/execve event logging paths to suppress events when required fields are missing."
  ],
  "🎁 Misc": [
    "Disabled monitoring of the accept system call in the system monitor to reduce unnecessary event capture. Concretely, accept syscall monitoring is turned off in the system monitor configuration/logic while tcp_accept eBPF handling continues to cover the needed network visibility.",
    "Bumped module dependencies to the latest Go patch level to keep builds consistent and up to date. All module go.mod files were updated from Go 1.24.11 to Go 1.24.12."
  ],
  "🐜 Bug Fixes": [
    "Updated the KubeArmor Helm chart so installations render correctly and workloads start with the intended settings. This updates the chart version and fixes workloads YAML/templating for CLI and TLS flags, imagePullSecrets, and tolerations handling.",
    "Reduced overhead and improved correctness for TCP accept event processing so it behaves consistently with TCP connect tracing. The eBPF tcp_accept path now uses a perf-buffer-backed context and safer protocol reads (direct sk_protocol when BTF is available, with an offset-based fallback for non-BTF builds) to reduce stack usage and avoid invalid protocol strings."
  ]
}
).
It will be converted into human-readable release notes sections in a follow-up commit.
