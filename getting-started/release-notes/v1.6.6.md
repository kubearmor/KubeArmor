# KubeArmor v1.6.6 Release Notes

**Date:** 2025-12-23

**Version:** v1.6.6

## 🎁 Misc

- Updated the Helm deployment charts so that new installations and upgrades now default to the KubeArmor v1.6.6 release for better alignment with the current software version. The kubearmor and kubearmor-operator Helm Chart.yaml files were updated so that both the chart version and appVersion fields now reference v1.6.6, ensuring the packaged manifests stay in sync with the underlying application binaries.
