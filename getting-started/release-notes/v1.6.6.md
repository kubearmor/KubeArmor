{
  "🎁 Misc": [
    "The Vagrant development environment documentation was improved so it is clearer how to get BPF-LSM working and which operating systems are supported. The Vagrant README now calls out the `NETNEXT=1` requirement for BPF-LSM-capable kernels (\u003e5.7), explicitly documents CentOS 9 and Ubuntu 22.04 details, lists default AppArmor/SELinux usage by distro, and refactors command examples for readability."
