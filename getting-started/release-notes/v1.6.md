## Key Features & Enhancements

### 🔐 **Advanced Process Arguments Matching**

- Introduced **argument-based matching for processes** in policies.

- Allows precise control over command-line arguments, enabling granular process enforcement.

- This feature is currently limited to BPFLSM.

- **Example policy:**

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: security.kubearmor.com/v1
  kind: KubeArmorPolicy
  metadata:
    name: allow-steampipe-args
  spec:
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: steampipe
    process:
      matchPaths:
      - path: /usr/bin/python3.6
        allowedArgs:
          - -m
          - modules.steampipe_aws
    action: Block
  ```

### ➕ **Add support for non-Kubernetes installation through the KubeArmor client**

### 📡 **DNS Visibility at Pod-Level**

- Added **DNS query tracing** on UDP to provide insights into domain lookups from workloads.
- Helps detect malicious behaviors like **DGA (Domain Generation Algorithms)** or unauthorized C2 communications.

### 🛡️ **New Policy Presets**

- **ProtectProc:** Blocks unauthorized access to the `/proc` directory by non-owner processes.
- **ProtectEnv:** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive environment variables in `/proc/[pid]/environ`.
- **ExecPreset:** Enforces restrictions on external process executions (e.g., via `kubectl exec`).

### 🔌 **Container Runtime Enhancements**

- **OCI Hooks Support:**
  - Added support for **containerd** and **CRI-O hooks**, eliminating the need for exposing runtime UNIX sockets for container events.

### 📈 **Improved Telemetry and Observability**

- Added **TTY information** in BPF-LSM generated telemetry.
- Enhanced telemetry with **network metadata** using Kubernetes informers.
- Extended alert resources to include **full command arguments**.

### 🌐 **Ecosystem and Integrations**

- **OpenSearch Support:** Added OpenSearch as a datasource for process graphs in Grafana dashboards.
- Integrated **image vulnerability scanning workflows** (via Trivy) in release pipelines.

## 🛠️ Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements

- Resolved **memory leaks** in AppArmor DaemonSet (observed in AKS clusters).
- Fixed **policy deletion logic** for recommended policies in the operator.
- Addressed **KubeArmorClusterPolicy enforcement issue** for pods created post-policy application.
- Fixed panic errors with uninitialized Docker daemons.
- Resolved **tolerations propagation issues** in Helm chart deployments.
- Improved filtering logic in `karmor profile` commands to respect namespace, pod, and container filters.
- Fixed PID/HostPID and PPID/HostPPID display anomalies (e-notation issues).

## ⚙️ Additional Improvements

- Helm charts updated to handle tolerations properly.
- Introduced **conditional deployment** of pod refresh controllers.
- Updated CI pipelines to use Ubuntu 22.04 runners and separated network tests for newer kernels.
- Deprecated legacy Config Watcher in favor of **karmor.yaml configuration**.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes

- **Preset API Specification Updated:**

  - Action is now defined per-preset level:

    ```yaml
    presets:
      - name: protectEnv
        action: Block
    ```

- Configuration changes via `karmor.yaml` will eventually replace existing ConfigMap fields.

## 📖 Documentation Updates

- Revised hardening policies and presets documentation.
- Updated multi-OS deployment instructions and CLI long descriptions.
- Added ModelArmor use-cases and a better getting started guide

## ✅ Upgrade Notes

- Users are advised to review preset configurations and update CRDs accordingly.
- When upgrading from v1.5, ensure Helm charts are updated to leverage new toleration handling and configuration management features.

## v1.6.4 — 2025-11-12

### New Features
- Added USB Device Observability and Enforcement, including a new USB Device Handler and corresponding CRD updates for Host Security Policies. See PRs [#2172](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/pull/2172) and [#2194](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/pull/2194). Refer to the guide: [USB Device Handler](../../getting-started/usb_device_handler.md).
- Introduced File Integrity Monitoring via IMA hash matching with dynamic (un)initialization of the IMA module for flexible activation. See PR [#2170](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/pull/2170).
- Added structured telemetry support with a new `EventData` field to simplify downstream parsing and analysis. See PR [#2204](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/pull/2204).
- Added OCI hook support for unorchestrated Podman (rootful and rootless) environments to improve non-Kubernetes deployments. See PR [#1874](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/pull/1874) and docs: [OCI hooks](../../wiki/oci_hooks_kubearmor.md).

### Improvements
- Ensured CRI-O 1.34 compatibility by adding the `docker.io` prefix to image repositories.
- Operator: added support for `nodeSelector` and environment configuration via the `KubeArmorConfig` CRD. See PR [#2187](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/pull/2187).
- Operator Helm values: moved `imagePullSecrets` to `.Values.kubearmorOperator.image.imagePullSecrets` for clarity. See PR [#2190](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/pull/2190).
- Helm: corrected tolerations indentation in the operator template. See PR [#2138](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/pull/2138).
- Fixed system monitor compilation on certain RHEL kernels for improved portability.

### Bug Fixes
- Presets: populated the `action` field for preset alerts to avoid empty actions. See PR [#2210](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/pull/2210).
- Operator: fixed a panic when updating the controller’s node selector. See PR [#2193](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/pull/2193).
- Feeder: fixed missing `action` in syscall logs. See PR [#2169](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/pull/2169).
- Core/Logs: fixed missing labels in emitted logs to improve traceability.
- Dependencies: bumped `cilium/ebpf` to resolve BTF parsing issues. See PR [#2200](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/pull/2200).
- Addressed Go vulnerability advisories by updating dependencies across modules.

### Documentation
- Added USB Device Handler documentation: [USB Device Handler](../../getting-started/usb_device_handler.md).
- FAQ: documented an alternative method to enable BPF-LSM on RHEL using `grubby`. See PR [#2174](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/pull/2174).
- Consolidated release notes under `getting-started/release-notes/` for easier discovery.

### Build/Release
- Updated GoReleaser configuration (bundle flag added; removed deprecated certificate field) and other build tweaks. These changes do not impact runtime behavior.
