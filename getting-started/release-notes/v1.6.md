# KubeArmor v1.6 Release Notes

We are excited to announce the release of **KubeArmor v1.6**, packed with powerful new features, significant enhancements, and critical bug fixes that make workload protection and observability even more robust for cloud-native environments.

This release reflects major advancements in policy enforcement, system monitoring, and ecosystem integrations while addressing important stability and performance improvements.

## KubeArmor v1.6.8 (2026-02-25)

### 🆕 New Features

- Added automatic container runtime identification by determining the runtime from the detected socket path.
- Added a `--socket-file` option (via Helm to `snitch`) to explicitly select the container runtime socket when multiple CRI sockets are present.
- Added cached UID-to-username resolution so host logs and alerts show human-readable usernames more reliably.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed race conditions in endpoint and host policy updates by tightening locking, copying slices under read locks, and adding dedicated race tests.
- Fixed RHEL9 build gating so `RHEL9_BUILD_GTE_400` is defined only when the RHEL9 build number is >= 400.

### 🎁 Misc

- Improved race-condition tests by randomizing endpoint removal and shortening runtime.
- Improved default resource settings by adding CPU and memory requests/limits for relay, controller, DaemonSet, and snitch components.
- Improved DaemonSet rendering to always apply CRI socket arguments in the correct order after init-container configuration.
- Improved host-only mode and USB audit logs by adding timestamps to USB events and setting `k8s=false` for host-only runs.
- Updated Go to `1.24.13` and bumped `github.com/cilium/cilium` to `v1.18.4`.
- Updated stable release metadata from `v1.6.6` to `v1.6.8`.
- Improved CI and test configuration by using the correct Helm image tag key for `kubearmor-operator` and passing the LSM order flag during test runs.

## Key Features & Enhancements

### 🔐 **Advanced Process Arguments Matching**

- Introduced **argument-based matching for processes** in policies.

- Allows precise control over command-line arguments, enabling granular process enforcement.

- This feature is currently limited to BPFLSM.

- **Example policy:**

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: security.kubearmor.com/v1
  kind: KubeArmorPolicy
  metadata:
    name: allow-steampipe-args
  spec:
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: steampipe
    process:
      matchPaths:
      - path: /usr/bin/python3.6
        allowedArgs:
          - -m
          - modules.steampipe_aws
    action: Block
  ```

### ➕ **Add support for non-Kubernetes installation through the KubeArmor client**

### 📡 **DNS Visibility at Pod-Level**

- Added **DNS query tracing** on UDP to provide insights into domain lookups from workloads.
- Helps detect malicious behaviors like **DGA (Domain Generation Algorithms)** or unauthorized C2 communications.

### 🛡️ **New Policy Presets**

- **ProtectProc:** Blocks unauthorized access to the `/proc` directory by non-owner processes.
- **ProtectEnv:** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive environment variables in `/proc/[pid]/environ`.
- **ExecPreset:** Enforces restrictions on external process executions (e.g., via `kubectl exec`).

### 🔌 **Container Runtime Enhancements**

- **OCI Hooks Support:**
  - Added support for **containerd** and **CRI-O hooks**, eliminating the need for exposing runtime UNIX sockets for container events.

### 📈 **Improved Telemetry and Observability**

- Added **TTY information** in BPF-LSM generated telemetry.
- Enhanced telemetry with **network metadata** using Kubernetes informers.
- Extended alert resources to include **full command arguments**.

### 🌐 **Ecosystem and Integrations**

- **OpenSearch Support:** Added OpenSearch as a datasource for process graphs in Grafana dashboards.
- Integrated **image vulnerability scanning workflows** (via Trivy) in release pipelines.

## 🛠️ Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements

- Resolved **memory leaks** in AppArmor DaemonSet (observed in AKS clusters).
- Fixed **policy deletion logic** for recommended policies in the operator.
- Addressed **KubeArmorClusterPolicy enforcement issue** for pods created post-policy application.
- Fixed panic errors with uninitialized Docker daemons.
- Resolved **tolerations propagation issues** in Helm chart deployments.
- Improved filtering logic in `karmor profile` commands to respect namespace, pod, and container filters.
- Fixed PID/HostPID and PPID/HostPPID display anomalies (e-notation issues).

## ⚙️ Additional Improvements

- Helm charts updated to handle tolerations properly.
- Introduced **conditional deployment** of pod refresh controllers.
- Updated CI pipelines to use Ubuntu 22.04 runners and separated network tests for newer kernels.
- Deprecated legacy Config Watcher in favor of **karmor.yaml configuration**.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes

- **Preset API Specification Updated:**

  - Action is now defined per-preset level:

    ```yaml
    presets:
      - name: protectEnv
        action: Block
    ```

- Configuration changes via `karmor.yaml` will eventually replace existing ConfigMap fields.

## 📖 Documentation Updates

- Revised hardening policies and presets documentation.
- Updated multi-OS deployment instructions and CLI long descriptions.
- Added ModelArmor use-cases and a better getting started guide

## ✅ Upgrade Notes

- Users are advised to review preset configurations and update CRDs accordingly.
- When upgrading from v1.5, ensure Helm charts are updated to leverage new toleration handling and configuration management features.
