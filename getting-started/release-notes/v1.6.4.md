# KubeArmor v1.6.4 Release Notes

**Date:** 2025-11-28  
**Version:** v1.6.4

## New Features

- Added support for pulling images from private registries, allowing KubeArmor to be deployed from non‑public container registries and configured via operator‑provided image‑pull secrets.

## Improvements

- Improved overall release robustness for v1.6.5, including more reliable CI and systemd-based pipelines, better feeder reliability with resource‑leak prevention and coverage metrics, stronger USB device handler test coverage, updated stable‑release metadata, and standardized internal documentation style guides.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed system monitor compilation failures on RHEL kernels and resolved loading issues on Linux 5.4 kernels caused by unbounded min-value pointer arithmetic, restoring monitoring functionality on affected systems.
- Fixed AppArmor enforcement when KubeArmor was deployed in namespaces other than `kubearmor`, ensuring policies are enforced consistently across namespaces.
- Resolved multiple issues in systemd-based release CI pipelines, restoring reliable automated build and release workflows for official KubeArmor images.
