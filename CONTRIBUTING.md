# How to Contribute to KubeArmor?

1. Pick an [issue](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Akubearmor+sort%3Aupdated-desc) to work on. For first-time contributors, the best would be to pick an issue [tagged good-first-issue](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Akubearmor+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc).

2. If you feel adventurous and would like to take a challenging issue, we would love to have you contribute on issues [tagged help-wanted](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Akubearmor+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc).

3. There is a [Contribution Guide](contribution/contribution_guide.md) that explains how to create a fork and raise PR on GitHub.

4. If the issue involves code changes you need to install development env using this [Development Guide](contribution/development_guide.md).

# Scope of Contribution

Contributions are not necessarily in the form of code changes. KubeArmor community can benefit from contributions such as:

1. [Policy-Templates](https://github.com/kubearmor/policy-templates)

   Users are welcome to contribute policy-templates for their workloads. The workloads have to be generic enough such that it benefits the wider community. E.g., if someone brings up a system policy restricting access to nginx process that would be useful in multiple scenarios and for the wider community then come up with a policy-template that is specific to your proprietary application.

2. Blogs

   a. Explain The use of KubeArmor's features (KVMService, Event Auditor, Visibility, etc)

   b. Describe How to use KubeArmor to protect your workload with specific use-cases you may have. Please do not shy away from getting as technical as you can.

   c. Put your topic of interest

3. Feedback to the community

   Just helping advance any discussion on KubeArmor Slack, Community meetings, office hours will make a big difference.

4. Talking about KubeArmor in meetups

   We would certainly encourage users or devs of KubeArmor to talk about it in open/closed forums. The community can help with logistics such as compiling/feedback on slide-decks, technical diagrams, etc.
